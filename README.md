## About Slime Slayer Santa
##### Main Concepts
<details>
	<summary>Spoiler Warning (Read only after finishing the game)</summary>
	<p>
	At the surface Slime Slayer Santa is a simple "defeat the slimes" game.
	But, the main mechanic of the game is its ability to recognize changes in the game files and react accordingly.
	For example: Removing the collision file causes all collisions to be disabled. This causes santa's snowballs to pass through the enemy and causes all enemy attacks to pass through santa.
	The game's ability to react to file changes is subtly hinted to the player with the use of an intended error message during the first launch of the game asking the player to either remove audio.js to the trash folder or to edit the audio.js files hence demonstrating the two primary ways the game recognizes file changes.
	This leads to interesting puzzles forcing the player to constantly change files to complete rounds which would be otherwise impossible to do.
