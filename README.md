## About Slime Slayer Santa
##### Main Concepts
<details>
    <summary>Spoiler Warning (Read only after finishing the game)</summary>
	<p>
	At the surface Slime Slayer Santa is a simple "defeat the slimes" game.
	But, the main mechanic of the game is its ability to recognize changes in the game files and react accordingly.
	For example: Removing the collision file causes all collisions to be disabled. This causes santa's snowballs to pass through the enemy and causes all enemy attacks to pass through santa.
	The game's ability to react to file changes is subtly hinted to the player with the use of an intended error message during the first launch of the game asking the player to either remove audio.js to the trash folder or to edit the audio.js files hence demonstrating the two primary ways the game recognizes file changes.
	This leads to interesting puzzles forcing the player to constantly change files to complete rounds which would be otherwise impossible to do.
	The game also provides hints in the form of intentional "accidental logs" below the game canvas.

## Walkthrough
<details>
	<summary>Spoiler Warning (Read only if stuck)</summary>
	<details><summary>Chasers</summary><p>Chasers will chase santa in a slow snail like way. Use the speed advantage to quickly shoot them down.</p></details>
		<details><summary>Shooters</summary>Shooters spew slimeballs at the Santa, slowing Santa and doing damage on impact. Disable the slimeBallEffect.js file by moving it from the GameFiles folder to the Trash folder, or setting globalState.slimeBallEffect = false; using any text editor. This will effectively disable the effect of all slimeballs in the game.</details>
		<details><summary>Excreters</summary>Excreters excrete out toxic slime, covering almost the whole canvas. This causes Santa to use slimeballs instead of snowballs. Make sure to reenable slimeBallEffect.js file by moving it from the Trash folder to the GameFiles folder, or setting globalState.slimeBallEffect = true; using any text editor. This will reenable all slimeballs. </details>
		<details><summary>Dashers</summary>Dashers dash at Santa at high speeds and instantly kill him on impact. Disable collision.js by moving it from the GameFiles folder to the Trash folder, or setting globalState.collision = false; using any text editor. This will disable all collisions in the game causing the dashers to miss and go off the screen. This also results in santa being able to go offscreen and causes all snowballs/slimeballs to pass through Santa and the slimes. Make sure to reenable collision.js by moving it from the Trash folder to the GameFiles folder, or setting globalState.collision = true; using any text editor after the round ends.</details>
		<details><summary>Absorbers</summary>Absorbers absorb Santa's attacks and increase their health by negating the damage done to them. Make the player do "negative" damage by setting globalState.playerDamage = -1; in playerDamage.js in the GameFiles folder using any text editor. This will cause the Absorber to take damage. Make sure to set globalState.playerDamage = 1; after the round ends to prevent Santa from healing any subsequent enemies.</details>
		<details><summary>slimeMaster64</summary>slimeMaster64 borrows its attacks from all the slimes that came before. The first phase is the same as Chasers except that slimeMaster64 kills in 1 hit. The second phase is where slimeMaster64 start spewing slimeBalls, disable slimeBallEffect.js and damage slimeMaster64 using your snowballs. slimeMaster64 notice its slimeBalls are not working and then switches to the third phase which is the same as Excreters. Enable slimeBallEffect.js and damage slimeMaster64 with your slimeBalls. slimeMaster64 notices that slimeballs are working and switches to its second phase. This continues until slimeMaster64 reaches 40% health. Then the next phase is the same as Absorbers. The last phase is similar to Dashers where slimeMaster64 dashes at the player at high speed and instantly kills the player on contact. Disabling collision.js causes slimeMaster64 to pass through the player and then stop near the border. slimeMaster64 can be defeated by first disabling collision.js before slimeMaster64 dashes and then enabling it as soon as it passes the player and before it reaches the wall. This causes slimeMaster64 to slam the wall and take damage. This can be done easily by pausing the game at the correct time. Using the corners and causing slimeMaster64 to dash along diagonals gives the most time to the player to pause the game. </details>

## How Slime Slayer Santa accesses the filesystem
Many browsers dont allow websites to access the client's filesystem because of potential security hazards. A workaround to this that has been used is to import the required files using html script tags. These execute an onerror handler when the file is not found and execute the code in the file if the file is found. A drawback to this method is that since this needs to be done continuosly it results in the console being flooded with 404 not found errors which cannot be caught using javascript's try - except clause, and also that it drains performance.  The problem of the constant stream of uncatchable 404 errors has been tackled by clearing the console when the file is not found and replaced with a more friendly message.
